% Module to create WOOPER instance proxies.
%
-module(wooper_instance_proxy).


% The purpose of a proxy P is to be a process that acts as a man-in-the-middle
% for a WOOPER target instance T: all processes interacting with P will actually
% interact transparently with T.
%
% This can be useful when, for example, a local process (P) is needed (ex: must
% be locally registered), whereas the actual service is implemented by a remote
% instance (T).
%
% Note that this proxy is only as transparent as reasonably achievable and,
% that, anyway, proxies are seldom satisfactory solutions.
