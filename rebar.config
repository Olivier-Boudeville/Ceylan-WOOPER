% This is a configuration file of rebar3, so that Ceylan-WOOPER can better
% integrate in the current OTP ecosystem, despite its (more complex, probably
% more flexible) native build based on GNU make.

% If the name of this file is 'rebar.config', then it is a generated file,
% otherwise it is a template (in conf/rebar.config.template), meant to be filled
% by information coming from GNUmakevars.inc.
%
% See the Myriad counterpart file (same name) for more explanations.


% Base layout was obtained thanks to: 'rebar3 new app wooper', as WOOPER is an
% active OTP application (not a mere library).

% To be taken into account, from the library root, through 'make
%  rebar3-application' or 'make rebar3-release'.


% Settings for the 'default' profile follow.


% Depends on the Ceylan-Myriad OTP library application (Erlang implied):

% As a GIT-based dependency:
{deps, [ {myriad, {git, "git://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Myriad", {branch, "master"}}} ] }.


% As an hex-package dependency:
%
% (works if the package uses a specific hook script, see
% hex-compile-hook-script.sh, to compensate for the GNUmake* root files that the
% package archive will not include at their location)
%
%{deps, [ {myriad, "1.0.12"} ] }.



% Include directories found in INC:
{erl_opts, [ {d,myriad_debug_mode}, {d,wooper_debug_mode}, debug_info, {debug_info_key,"Ceylan-Myriad"}, report_warnings, warn_export_all, warn_export_vars, warn_shadow_vars, warn_obsolete_guards, warn_unused_import, warnings_as_errors, {parse_transform,wooper_parse_transform}, {i,"src"}, {i,"../myriad/include/"}, {i,"include"}, {i,"examples"}, {i,"../Ceylan-Myriad/include/data-management"}, {i,"../Ceylan-Myriad/include/maths"}, {i,"../Ceylan-Myriad/include/meta"}, {i,"../Ceylan-Myriad/include/user-interface/src"}, {i,"../Ceylan-Myriad/include/user-interface/src/textual"}, {i,"../Ceylan-Myriad/include/user-interface/src/graphical"}, {i,"../Ceylan-Myriad/include/utils"}, {i,"../Ceylan-Myriad/include/scripts"}, {i,"../Ceylan-Myriad/include/apps/merge-tool"} ]}.


% Bootstrapped modules (from BOOTSTRAP_MODULES):
{erl_first_files, [ "src/wooper_info.erl" ]}.


% Could not set REBAR_PROFILE=$(REBAR_PROFILE):
{pre_hooks,  [ {compile, "make -s rebar3-compile-pre-hook"} ]}.
{post_hooks, [ {compile, "make -s rebar3-compile-post-hook"} ]}.
